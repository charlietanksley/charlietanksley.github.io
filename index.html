      <div>
        <h3>Work</h3>
        <p>
          I'm currently a tech lead for an integrations team
          at <a href='https://threeflow.com'>ThreeFlow</a>. We are a
          benefit placement system, and my team automates the movement
          of data to/from our system from/to systems of insurance brokers and
          carriers.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a former academic, I've always been interested in being an
          effective leader, mentor, and coach. In my current role, I
          focus heavily on helping the team have shared mental models,
          an effective technical strategy, enough ownership to be able
          to impact the codebase effectively, and a common design sense
          so our codebase is coherent.
        </p>

        <h3>Everywhere else</h3>
        <p>
          You won't find much of my current work online. I don't tend to
          code in my free time anymore, and I don't have a social media
          presence. I like to:

          <ul>
            <li>Spend time with family.</li>
            <li>Garden (mostly flowers).</li>
            <li>Do ham radio (focusing on CW right now).</li>
            <li>Read.</li>
            <li>Mess around with cheap/old cameras.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>If you'd like to know a bit more, I might have updated my <a href='./now.html'>now</a> page.
