      <p>
        Right now I'm spending time doing a handful of hobbies:
        <ul>
          <li>Ham radio</li>
          <li>Cameras</li>
          <li>Gardening</li>
        </ul>
      <p>

      <div>
        <h3>Ham Radio</h3>
        <p>
          I'm spending a fair bit of time on Morse code (CW) these
          days. I got my amateur radio license in January of
          2023. Around October 2023 I made my first CW QSO, and
          November I started working on awards with
          the <a href='https://www.skccgroup.com/'>Straight Key
          Century Club</a>. That's a great group, and I enjoy it
          immensely.
        </p>
        <p>
          In January of this year I took a course
          with <a href='https://cwinnovations.net/'>CWInnovations</a>. It
          was an excellent course, with a great group of folks, and I
          learned a ton. I'm still working on building speed and
          fluency, but I'm much better than I was at the start of the
          year!

        <h3>Cameras</h3>
        <p>
          I like cheap cameras, toy cameras, and old cameras. This year I've used:
          <ul>
            <li>A <a href='https://www.ultrafineonline.com/suhekigohaca.html'>Superheadz
                Hello Kitty</a> half frame camera to document a trip to the mountains.</li>
            <li>My
                trusty <a href='https://shop.panasonic.com/products/tough-waterproof-digital-camera'>Lumix</a>
                waterproof digital camera at the lake and river.</li>
            <li>A <a href='https://www.amightygirl.com/dragon-touch-camera'>Dragon
                Touch</a> instant print camera (it prints on receipt
                paper!) camping with the family.</li>
            <li>A <a href='https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/dslr789.html'>Canon
                Rebel XT</a> with a cheap 70-300mm lens to photograph
                birds and critters in my yard.</li>
            <li>A
                Praktica <a href='http://www.praktica-collector.de/136_Praktica_FX3.htm'>FX3</a>
                that I got for Christmas. I only used this one around
                the yard, and the learning curve feels high with the
                top-down viewfinder!</li>
            <li>And I just acquired, and look forward to using, an
                Olympus <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Pen#EE_series'>PEN
                EE-2</a> half frame. I hope to use this for some
                travel soon, but need to see if it works!</li>
          </ul>

      <div>
        <h3>Gardening</h3>
        <p>
          I'm trying to rework my various beds to take them back from
          weeds and aggressive volunteer plants. I'm hopeful I can get
          some bulbs in this fall and have a really lovely spring.
